Hey everyone, 

(impossible)TicTacToe is my first ever project with JavaScript

Im just getting to know this language but it does noe seems as hard as everyone tells, I fell like you "just" need patience and eagle eye to be good at it.

We'll see in the future,

btw if you have idea for some easy and fun project to start with me share them with me :D
